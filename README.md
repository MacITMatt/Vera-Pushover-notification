# Vera-pushover-notificaion
Use pushover with your Vera!

## Getting Started

Do you have a Vera Smart Home Controller and want push notifications when stuff happens? Follow the attached guide and you can setup custom alerts directly using PushOver API.


### Prerequisites

Setup Pushover

1. Sign up for [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)
2. Create an App inside pushover
3. Note your User API key and App API key
4. Setup the [Pushover client](https://pushover.net/clients/) on a device 


### Adding Lua Code to your scene

1. Create a scene inside the Vera WebUI and select "execute the following Lua code:"
2. Copy/Paste example code from [notification.lua](notification.lua)
3. Replace <user token> and <app token> with your API keys from Pushover
4. Enjoy getting notified when stuff happens

### Variables Explained:
`user: <User Token>`
Located on Pushover [dashboard page](https://pushover.net/)

`token: <App token>`
Located on Pushover [Apps page](https://pushover.net/apps)

`message:` 
Content of your message (i.e. garage door is now open)

`title:` 
Subject line of message (i.e. Door opened)

`priority:` 
1 = High priority (alert all hours, and make noise)
0 = normal (ignored during quite hours)
-1 = Low priority

Additional variables as supported by [Pushover](https://pushover.net/api)

## Debuging Lua Code

You can view Lua log files on your controller by going the following URL:  
http://<Your Vera Controller IP>/port_3480/data_request?id=lua

Another helpful troubleshooting tool is to execute Lua code locally on the controller. To do this you will need to enable SSH on the Vera:

```
